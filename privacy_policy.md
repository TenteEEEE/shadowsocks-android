The shadowsocks-android is built as an Open Source software. This app is provided by Shadowsocks Team at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our app.

**Information Collection and Use**

**We do not collect personal information.** This app is designed to protect your privacy and does not gather, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about you to our servers or third parties.

**No Third-Party Analytics or Tracking**

This app does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or tracking services that would collect information about you.

All app data, including your proxy configurations and preferences, are stored locally on your device. This information is not transmitted to us or any third party unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.

**Network Connections**

The app may make the following network connections for functionality purposes only:

*   **Connection Testing**: The app may connect to `cp.cloudflare.com` to test your proxy connection. This is a simple connectivity check and no personal information is transmitted.
*   **Rule Updates**: The app may download updated proxy rules from `shadowsocks.org` to improve functionality. No personal information is sent during these updates.
*   **User-Configured Subscriptions**: If you choose to use subscription services, the app will connect to URLs you specify to download proxy configurations. We do not control or monitor these connections.
